# Investing Philosophy

- **Prioritize Skill Investment:** Focus on acquiring skills that generate cash flow.
  - **Adopt a Stoic Mindset:** Emphasize emotional control (90%) over technical knowledge (10%).
  - **Embrace Short-Term Discomfort:** Accept temporary setbacks like losses, pain, and fatigue as necessary sacrifices to avoid long-term regret and failure.
- **Long-Term Perspective:** View these temporary challenges as crucial steps towards achieving significant goals and preventing greater future suffering.

## Investment Strategy Summary

- **Contrarian Approach**

  - Invest in underperforming Sector ETFs(Stock, Real Estate, Commodities, etc.) when they hit their lowest point.

- **Dollar-Cost Averaging**

  - Divide your investment budget into 3 equal parts and invest 1/3 of your investment budget when the price is decreasing by 10% or just buy 1/3 of your investment budget every month.
  - Use leftover salary to invest regularly, reducing the impact of market timing.

- **Monthly Reviews**

  - Check market trends and asset performance monthly to adjust or switch investments if needed.

- **No Stop-Loss Strategy**

  - Confident in chosen assets, no stop-loss orders; relies on market research and patience.

- **Support Confirmation Before Switching**

  - Only switch to a better-performing ETF after confirming support levels for at least one month.

- **Diversification Plan**

  - Once financial goals are achieved, expand your portfolio for stability and long-term growth.
